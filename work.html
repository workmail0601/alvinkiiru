                <h3>Hope for Rural Widows Kenya - Youth Division</h3>
                <span class="work-years"> Organization Lead</span>
                <span class="work-years"> September 2022 - Present</span>
                <p>I co-lead the Youth division of Hope for Rural Widows in Kenya(The Amani 
                  Visionary Youth Group - Miathene, Meru County). The organization is 
                  changing youth mindset and empowering them to establish solutions to 
                  their challenges from within. 
                  In my time at Amani, this is what we have so far been able to achieve; 
                  Created a partnership with the local Polytechnic in Miathene to offer free 
                  certified courses to at least 100 youth - 20 of which were from the youth 
                  group. 
                  Created an internally funded financial model that provided the members 
                  access to loans, which we leveraged as an income generation source. 
                  Worked to develop sports as a means to reduce idle time - particularly 
                  through football competitions at the local primary school.
                   Worked with 15 primary schools in Miathene, Tigania West Constituency to 
                  offer incentives for people in primary schools to work hard and stay in school  
                  through prize giving events for top performers - we also created a model 
                  where all awardees would be automatically enlisted as members of the youth 
                  group - so as to ensure they are monitored and do not fall through the cracks. 
                  Fostered partnerships with EFAC - to create a platform where the most 
                  needy and promising would get access to highschool and university 
                  scholarships. </p>
