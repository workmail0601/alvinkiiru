              <span class="work-years"> Volunteer Management and Site Visit Lead. </span>
              <p>I was contracted by Metis collective to assist in the recruitment and 
                management of volunteers for the third edition of the ReimaginED Summit. 
                We recruited 15 high capacity volunteers who were put under my direction. 
                I developed an intricate 2 day schedule for volunteer stationing to maximize 
                capacities and minimize the numbers required - leading to a well balanced 
                budget.
                 I also managed an experiential site visit to SHOFCO Kibera School for Girls 
                (23rd of December 2023), where I led a group of guests in learning from 
                the school on how they are implementing the country’s new CBC model of 
                learning considering financial constraints.  
                I also co-led an awards session where we recognized 8 changemakers in 
                education and paid tribute to a recently fallen member of the Metis team.</p>

                <p>Part of my duties in my role as a member of the Metis Alumni Council were 
                  to make a presentation on the new platform (Mighty Networks) designed to 
                  empower the alumni to work together in a more cohesive fashion. 
                  I designed the presentation with my InDesign skills, and made a 20 minute 
                  presentation to the alumni focusing on value from their perspective. We 
                  managed to get 85% of the alumni to register for the platform during and 
                  immediately after the session, while at the same time paving the way for the 
                  bigger platform launch later that same year.</p>

            <span class="work-years"> Climate Resilience Conversation Co-Lead</span>
            <p>I co-led a conversation on behalf of Nikola Energy on climate change 
              together with Amisa Rashid (Nivishe Foundation), Grace Wanene (Drawing 
              Dreams Initiative) and Sheena Shah (Harvesting for Good East Africa), its

              solutions. 
              ReimaginED was an event hosted by Metis collective in a bid to bring key 
              stakeholders in education and climate change together.</p>

          <span class="work-years">  July - August 2024 </span>
          <p>My role at Metis collective as an Alumni Consultant allowed me to design and 
            execute a community of practice (COP) session on understanding the barriers 
            to improving the quality of education in low income areas (Kibera being 
            the sample area). We mobilized  Metis proximate leaders in education from 
            the area and over a course of 2 months, had discussions on the challenges 
            they faced in their quest to improve education, and the possible solutions to 
            aforementioned challenges. </p>

          <p>In my internship period at Nikola Energy, I managed a project together 
            with students from Africa Nazarene University to develop the first fully 
            independent automated handwashing system to help in curbing the spread 
            of COVID-19, by increasing access to safe handwashing services.</p>
